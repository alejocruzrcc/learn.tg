# Guide 1: Don't be afraid - Mark 6:45-52[^1]** **

**45 **Immediately He made his disciples get into the boat, and go ahead to the
other side, to Bethsaida, while He himself sent the multitude away. **46 **After
He had taken leave of them, He went up the mountain to pray.

**47 **When evening had come, the boat was in the middle of the sea, and He was
alone on the land. **48 **Seeing them distressed in rowing, for the wind was
contrary to them, about the fourth watch of the night he came to them, walking
on the sea, and He would have passed by them, **49 **but they, when they saw Him
walking on the sea, supposed that it was a ghost, and cried out; **50 **for they
all saw Him, and were troubled. But He immediately spoke with them, and said to
them, “Cheer up! It is I! Don’t be afraid.” **51 **He got into the boat with
them; and the wind ceased, and they were very amazed among themselves, and
marveled; **52 **for they hadn’t understood about the loaves, but their hearts
were hardened.  (Translation WEBUS).
