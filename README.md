#  Learn through games / Aprender mediante juegos

We have a prototype runnnig at https://learn.tg that already allows to:

* Organize courses into chapters and guides on the frontend.
* Each guide is written in Markdown.
* When a student connects with an OKX wallet they see more content.
* Has an initial backend that allows a teacher to organize courses into chapters and guides.


## Directory `servidor`
