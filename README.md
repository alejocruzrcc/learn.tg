#  Learn through games / Aprender mediante juegos

We have a prototype runnnig at https://learn.tg that already allows to:

* Organize courses into chapters and guides on the frontend.
* Each guide is written in Markdown.
* When a student connects with an OKX wallet they see more content.
* Has an initial backend that allows a teacher to organize courses into chapters and guides.


## Directory `servidor`

Backend application with rails based on
[cor1440](https://gitlab.com/pasosdeJesus/cor1440)

It must be started first.

See details at servidor/README.md


## Directory `cliente`

Frontend application with vue and vite.

See details at cliente/README.md
We will open its sources in this repository once we receive funding.
